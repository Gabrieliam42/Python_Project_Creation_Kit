# Python_Project_Creation_Kit



* Python Project Creation Kit is a collection of scripts that I developed in order to help save time when creating a new Python project or when testing one.

* The scripts also have exe compiled versions that can be used on a Windows operating system.








## AI Involvement

The scripts development did not depend on AI tools like ChatGPT, their main use was for creating code comments and descriptions.
